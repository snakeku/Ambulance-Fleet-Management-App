## [ProjectContext](#projectcontext)

Traditionally, when an ambulance breaks down or becomes unusable, users have to contact a specific stakeholder who is in charge of ambulance logistics. However, this person may be unavailable at night or when they are busy, making it challenging to access information on ambulance availability. Additionally, this information is typically siloed and only available to a select few. The Ambulance Fleet Management app provides a solution to these issues, making information on ambulance availability accessible to everyone.
